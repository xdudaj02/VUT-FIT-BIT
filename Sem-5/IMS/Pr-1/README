This project is Covid simulator created for IMS course at BUT FIT in 2021.
Default values used in this project were taken from statistics actual at the beginning of the december 2021.

Makefile
In Makefile, you can find all commands that you will need to operate the simulator:
	make all - compile source codes and creates program.
	make run [ARGS='[PARAM ARGUMENT]'] - launch program with parameter defined
		as [PARAM ARGUMENT] (for example: make run ARGS='-p 100')
	make pack - make .tar file with whole project.
	make doc - create Doxygen documentation.
	make clean - delete files generated by Makefile.

Usage: ./covid_simulator [PARAMETERS]
Each parameter, except -h needs argument and following parameters are valid:
  -h    Print help message.
  -d  [ARGUMENT]  Set duration of the simulation in days. How many simulation's
        steps will be done. ARGUMENT should be an integer larger than 0.
  -p  [ARGUMENT]  Set total population at the start of the simulation. ARGUMENT
        should be an integer larger than 0.
  -i  [ARGUMENT]  Set number of infected people at the start of the simulation.
        Those people are already infectious. ARGUMENT should be an integer
        larger than 0.
  -v  [ARGUMENT]  Set a percentage of the population, that is vaccinated.
        ARGUMENT should be a float number between 0 and 1 (including both),
        where 0 is 0% and 1 is 100%.
  -m  [ARGUMENT]  Set a chance of having mask, when person came to contact with
        the virus. By default, this chance is adaptive based on the infectious
        population (1% for each 10000 infectious). Using this parameter will
        make it static. ARGUMENT should be a float number between 0 and 1
        (including both), where 0 is 0% and 1 is 100%.
  -e  [ARGUMENT]  Set mask's efficiency. Chance, that mask will protect person
        from being infected. ARGUMENT should be a float number between 0 and 1
        (including both), where 0 is 0% and 1 is 100%.
  -n  [ARGUMENT]  Set how many new people enter the simulation. This value is
        used as an argument for poisson distribution. ARGUMENT should be
        an integer larger than or equal to 0.
  -c  [ARGUMENT]  Set total hospital capacity. This is limit how many people
        can be hospitalized at the same time. If someone new need
        hospitalization, and there isn't free capacity. Patient will die.
        ARGUMENT should be an integer larger than or equal to 0.
  -a  [ARGUMENT]  Set virus incubation. This value is used as an argument for
        poisson distribution. ARGUMENT should be an integer larger than or
        equal to 0.
  -r  [ARGUMENT]  Set patient's recovery duration. This value is used as
        an argument for poisson distribution. ARGUMENT should be an integer
        larger than or equal to 0.
  -s  [ARGUMENT]  Set a decisive point for the patient. This point is symbolize
        the duration after which patient's fate will be decided. This point has
        meaning only when patient was also hospitalized (had hard symptoms).
        The value is used as an argument for poisson distribution. ARGUMENT
        should be an integer larger than or equal to 0.
  -u  [ARGUMENT]  Set an immunity duration. How long will person be immune to
        the virus after successful recovery. Argument should be an integer
        larger than 0.
  -t  [ARGUMENT]  Set a chance of being protected by immunity, if vaccinated.
        ARGUMENT should be a float number between 0 and 1 (including both),
        where 0 is 0% and 1 is 100%.
  -o  [ARGUMENT]  Set a chance of being hospitalized when virus' incubation is
        over, if vaccinated. ARGUMENT should be a float number between 0 and 1
        (including both), where 0 is 0% and 1 is 100%.
  -b  [ARGUMENT]  Set a chance of death when patient reach decisive point
        and is hospitalized, if patient was vaccinated. ARGUMENT should be
        a float number between 0 and 1 (including both), where 0 is 0%
        and 1 is 100%.
  -f  [ARGUMENT]  Set a chance of being protected by immunity, if unvaccinated.
        ARGUMENT should be a float number between 0 and 1 (including both),
        where 0 is 0% and 1 is 100%.
  -g  [ARGUMENT]  Set a chance of being hospitalized when virus' incubation is
        over, if unvaccinated. ARGUMENT should be a float number between 0
        and 1 (including both), where 0 is 0% and 1 is 100%.
  -j  [ARGUMENT]  Set a chance of death when patient reach decisive point
        and is hospitalized, if patient was unvaccinated. ARGUMENT should be
        a float number between 0 and 1 (including both), where 0 is 0%
        and 1 is 100%.
